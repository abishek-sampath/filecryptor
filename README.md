# filecryptor
A new and innovative way to protect files by encrypting rather than locking. It is a common knowledge that any file that is known to be locked will have someone trying the break the lock and password. So this happens only if it is known that the file is locked witha password.

My application does not indicate that file is locked, nor does it ask for a password when opened by an outsider. it shows as, file is corrupted, so that the other person might think that the file is not usable anymore. so the file is actually safe and secure, and it is known only to the user that it is locked and encrypted.

Please try the application by yourself.

Any queries, please mail me at robinabishek@gmail.com

1. put all 3 files under a single folder and open in netbeans(if possible).
2. Run the filecryptorUI.java file in netbeans(if possible) or run in any java compiler.
3. whence UI is generated, select a file to be encrytped and give a key and press encrypt.
4. Decrypting is the reverse.
